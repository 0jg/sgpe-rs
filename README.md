# Stochastic Grossâ€“Pitaevskii Equation (Rust)
This library implements a stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SGPE) solver for simulating Bose-Einstein condensates in various trap configurations. The code is written in Rust (https://www.rust-lang.org).

The documentation is available within the crate: https://crates.io/crates/sgpe.
